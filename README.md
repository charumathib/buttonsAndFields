# buttonsAndFields
An example of a login screen which does two functions:
1. Sign up - if you don't already have an account, the account name and password will be added to a local file
2. Sign in - if the username and password are not already stored, the display field will show "Account disabled". If it does exist, the display field will show "Signed in".
